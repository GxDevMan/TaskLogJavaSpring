# Task Log Java Spring Boot Rest Frame Work Project

This project was made with the aim of exploring java spring.
This a rest framework that mainly deals in JSON payload

The rest framework app has an accounts feature, meaning each user can create their own tasks
they can track and update. Session handling data is mainly stored in the database itself. The 
main database is mysql used in this project during testing but the java spring can create the tables
automatically so no sql table creation code was used
to create the table. 

The project also has 2 roles mainly user and admin.
